# Claude Setup TODOs

Ideas and improvements for the Claude/AI development setup.

## High Priority

- [ ] **Vulnerability Management Agent** - Agent that monitors security advisories, CVEs, and dependency vulnerabilities across repos. Auto-creates issues or PRs for critical updates.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **End of day ritual** - Learn from sessions and improve setup. Skill that analyzes today's Claude sessions, extracts learnings, and suggests improvements to skills/CLAUDE.md/workflows.

- [ ] **Fork and customize compound-engineering** - Make it more effective for personal workflow. Trim unnecessary agents, tune prompts, add missing capabilities.

- [ ] **Notification system / Approval queue** - System for batching approval requests instead of interrupting. Could be a queue that accumulates while AFK, then review all at once.

- [ ] **Phone notifications for long-running sessions** - Alert when a session has been running >10min since last interaction. Useful for async work from phone. Could use Pushover, ntfy, or Slack webhook.

## Ideas to Explore

- [ ] Session summarization on disconnect
- [ ] Auto-commit learnings to `docs/solutions/`
- [ ] MCP health dashboard
- [ ] Cost tracking per session/project
