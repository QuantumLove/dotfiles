# DevContainer Opener

Open VSCode DevContainer with worktree-aware unique naming to avoid conflicts.

## Problem

VSCode DevContainers use hard-coded container names that conflict when using multiple git worktrees.

## Solution

Automatically updates container name based on current worktree/branch while preserving user data volumes.

## Usage

```bash
# From within any worktree
/dev-open

# Opens VSCode with container named: <project>-<branch>
# Example: inspect-action-fix-auth
```

## What it Does

1. Detects current project and branch
2. Updates container name to be unique per worktree
3. Preserves home volume (no re-authentication needed!)
4. Adds Claude configuration mounts automatically
5. Opens VSCode

## Example

```bash
cd ~/code/inspect-action-fix-auth
/dev-open

# Output:
# 🔍 DevContainer Setup
#    Project: inspect-action
#    Branch: fix-auth
#    Container: inspect-action-fix-auth
# 🚀 Opening VSCode DevContainer...
# ✅ DevContainer setup complete!
```

## Notes

- Home volumes are shared across worktrees (keeps credentials)
- Container names are unique per worktree (no conflicts)
- Changes to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` are temporary
- Reset with: `git checkout .devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

## Integration

This command is automatically called by `/start-work` when creating a new worktree in a project with DevContainers.
