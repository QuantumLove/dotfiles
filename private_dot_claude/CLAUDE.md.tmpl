# Personal Preferences

## Coding Philosophy

### Backwards Compatibility
- **Default:** Don't worry about backwards compatibility unless explicitly stated
- **When relevant:** Flag real concerns in plans and during code review
- **Action:** Without explicit confirmation, code as if backwards compatibility is not a concern
- **Exception:** If a change would break critical production systems or public APIs, flag it before proceeding

### General Approach
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over defensive/future-proof abstractions
- Delete unused code rather than commenting it out or adding deprecation shims
- When in doubt, ask rather than over-engineer
