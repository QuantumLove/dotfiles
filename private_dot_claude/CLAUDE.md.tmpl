# Personal Preferences

## Coding Philosophy

### Backwards Compatibility
- **Default:** Don't worry about backwards compatibility unless explicitly stated
- **When relevant:** Flag real concerns in plans and during code review
- **Action:** Without explicit confirmation, code as if backwards compatibility is not a concern
- **Exception:** If a change would break critical production systems or public APIs, flag it before proceeding

### General Approach
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over defensive/future-proof abstractions
- Delete unused code rather than commenting it out or adding deprecation shims
- When in doubt, ask rather than over-engineer

## Chezmoi Management

This Claude configuration is managed by chezmoi.
- **Source:** ~/.local/share/chezmoi/private_dot_claude/
- **Applied:** ~/.claude/
- **Apply changes:** `chezmoi apply`
- **See diff:** `chezmoi diff`
- **Backup/restore:** Just use git on the chezmoi source directory

### When to Edit Chezmoi (not the current repo)

If fixing personal tooling that spans projects, edit chezmoi source instead:

| Issue type | Edit chezmoi source |
|------------|---------------------|
| Shell functions (`~/.sh_functions`) | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_sh_functions.tmpl` |
| Warp configs | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_warp/` |
| Claude global settings | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/private_dot_claude/` |
| Zsh/Bash config | `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_zshrc.tmpl` |

**Workflow:** Edit source → `chezmoi apply` → test → commit to chezmoi repo
